GGSpammer - User Agreement

* You, the user is responsible for everything, you'll do. We don't take any responsibility for any action, you'll do
  with our tool. This tool isn't intended for malicious pursposes, but for education pursposes.

* Discord can take an action with accounts, that owns tokens you used for raiding. Not only your raiding accounts, but
  also your personal discord account. If not using appropriate protection, like virtual private network (VPN) and an
  alternative account while using this tool, you should be safe - but it's not guaranteed!

* Virtual private network (VPN) might not always provide a complete protection. Remember, discord is
  logging almost everything. If you do something bad, discord can actually take an action immediatelly or later.

If you're using GGSpammer, you must agree to this User Agreement. If you don't, we don't care - using this tool automatically
means that you agree to this User Agreement no matter if you actually did read them or not.
